/**
 * @brief Buffer representing device, host, or disk-backed storage.
 *
 * A `Buffer` holds device memory, host memory, or a disk-backed file handle,
 * determined by its memory type at construction. See `device_buffer_types`,
 * `host_buffer_types`, and `disk_buffer_types` for the supported memory types.
 *
 * Buffers are stream ordered and have an associated CUDA stream (see `stream()`). All
 * work that reads or writes the buffer must either be enqueued on that stream or be
 * synchronized with it before accessing the memory. For example, when passing the buffer
 * to a non-stream aware API (e.g., MPI or host-only code), the caller must ensure that
 * the most recent write has completed before the hand off. This can be done by
 * synchronizing the buffer's stream or by checking `is_latest_write_done()`.
 *
 * To obtain an `rmm::device_buffer` from a `Buffer`, first ensure that the buffer's
 * memory type is one of the types listed in `device_buffer_types` (moving the buffer if
 * necessary), then call `release_device_buffer()`.
 *
 * @note The constructors are private. Buffers are created through `BufferResource`.
